\textbf{What is this?}

This is the script for the 'Stars and Elementary Astrophysics' (SEA) lectures, which are part of AS1001. The script covers the \textit{skeleton of facts} for this course, including important equations and numbers. \textit{It is not a replacement for taking notes at the lectures.} The lectures will cover everything in this script, but with more illustrations, explanations, figures, animations, and examples. The slides from the lectures will \textit{not} be on Moodle.
 
The textbook for this course is Kutner's 'Astronomy - A Physical Perspective'. It is also used for 2nd year astronomy and explains things different, which makes it very useful.
